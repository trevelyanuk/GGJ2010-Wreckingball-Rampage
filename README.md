# GGJ2010-Wreckingball-Rampage
Global Game Jam 2010 Project

This project was created by myself, Dave Fletcher, Steve Wilson and Matt McCaffry at the University of Bedfordshire Global Game Jam in January 2010. 

We all of came from a background of having used C++ and OpenGL and as with all jams, developed the game over a 48 hour period of in a weekend.

The code is horrible and hacky in places and uses evil dependencies such as GLAUX, GLUT and OpenAL. It may well slow down, it might do weird things with the Win32 API, but it ultimately works.
